		1.   Introduction


	The "Snake" is a small game writen in Java. It is designed
and implemented by Alexander Dudarenko from Compact Soft group
at Ukraine. This game is provided as shareware; you are free to use,

	Now a few words about the game itself. It is simple. There are:

(1)	a big blue field (in which snake can move), with status line
	at the button;

(2)	a little (and growing to be very large, if you success!) green
	snake, which moves instantly,

(3)	obstacles (nasty white skulls),

(4)	and bonuses: red heart, silver and gold coins, and sacks, full
	of gold.

	The objective of game is simple: guide the moving green snake
collect bonuses, omit skulls (they are hazardous to snake's health!),
and don't strike the borders or snake itself. This way try to collect
as much points as possible.



		2.   Playing the Game: a Tutorial


	After that, you would see a big yellow field, and a small snake
in its center. It stands here. Press space bar, and it begins to move slowly.
Press space bar again, and its stops. Not very impressed with speed?
Try pressing the '+' key. Look at the bottom line of screen: the 'Level'
increases accordingly. There are ten speeds. computer only!). Increase
the speed, and press space bar again.  You may change speed at any time.

	Now use left and right arrow keys to change snake's direction.
Play with it for a while. Don't hit the borders or the snake's body --
it would die!

	As time passes, various objects appear on the screen randomly.
Please escape skulls as possible -- they take away your lives! (and
since you have no extra lives at beginning, you would die if you try to
'eat' one). Pay your attention to red hearts  -- they give you
extra lives: each face you have run through adds one extra life (watch
the top line), thus allowing you to safely eat one skull. Other thinks
you can meet are silver and gold coins.  Running on them gives you
points -- especially gold coins! See corresponding section below for
reference.

	Remember that if you drive the snake onto it's own body, it
dies immediately -- your lives don't count here. And so would happen
if you hit the border of game field. So please be aware!



		3.   Control keys reference


	The following table lists all keys used during the game. Also,
the button panel on top of the screen gives you a possibilities of them.

Key			Meaning

<Left arrow>,'j'	Turn snake to the left (respecting to its current direction)
			or go left in "four arrows" mode

<Right arrow>,'k'	Turn snake to the right
			or go right in "four arrows" mode

<Up arrow>,'a'		Go up in "four arrows" mode

<Down arrow>,'z'	Go down in "four arrows" mode

'g'			Start the snake if it is stopped (as at beginning of the game)

'p'			Stop the snake

'r'			Restart the game

<org.cs.Space bar>		Start, stop or restart game

'+'			Increase game level (therefore, speedup the snake)

'-'			Decrease level (slow the snake down)



		4.   Rules of scoring


	The current scoring (and the highest score) is displayed
on the top line. As you get points, the snake grows larger and larger:
one unit per ten points got (and you get one point for any single
'step', so snake grows even if you don't collect any bonuses, although
more slowly).

	One silver coin gives you 10 points.

	One gold coin of gold gives you 100 points.

	One red heart gifes you extra life.

	One skull gives you 50 points, too (only if you have extra
lives, or you die!). And you would lost one life, so don't forget to
check 'Lives' indicator at the bottom of screen.
